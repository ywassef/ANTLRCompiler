# Hydra Compiler

This is a C- compiler for the assembly language developed for the Hydra microprocessor architecture. This project was developed as a part of the ongoing project of development of a complete computational system for the Computational Systems Laboratories signatures of the Computer Engineering course at UNIFESP. This compiler was developed in C# and using the ANTLR parser generator (http://www.antlr.org/).
